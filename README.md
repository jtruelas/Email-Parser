#Email Parser

### Brief Description
This program is a simple project done in my intro CS class. It reads any type of files and extracts any potential email addresses out of it.

It then goes on to check the validity of the potential email addresses and checks for duplicates. It then removes the duplicates from the list.

Finally, it prints out the list of emails found. to the console as well as copy them to a text file for the purpose of pasting them in the fields cc or bcc.
